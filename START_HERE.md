## 🆘 Having Issues?

### Problem: "Database Disconnected"
**Solution:**
1. Check `.env` file exists in `/Users/mengyang/Desktop/JoyBilliards/`
2. Verify `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is correct
3. Restart dev server: Press `Ctrl+C`, then `npm run dev`

### Problem: Migration SQL Fails
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you copied the **entire** `supabase-migration.sql` file
2. If tables exist, drop them first:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS matches CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tournament_participants CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tournaments CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS players CASCADE;
```
3. Run migration SQL again

### Problem: Port 3000 in Use
**Solution:**
```bash
# Use a different port
npm run dev -- --port 3001
```

### Problem: Can't Find .env File
**Solution:**
The file might be hidden. Create it manually:
```bash
cd /Users/mengyang/Desktop/JoyBilliards
touch .env
open .env
# Then paste the configuration
```
